# Systems Engineering Exercise: Autonomous Deliver Robot (ADR)
The project consists of simulating simplified versions of the systems engineering management, requirements, architecture, and analysis activities associated with a real-world system development project, an autonomous delivery robot.

The project documents are consistent with [INCOSE’s Graduate Reference Curriculum for Systems Engineering (GRCSE)](https://www.incose.org/products-and-publications/se-graduate-reference-curriculum) and the [INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook (SEHB)](https://www.incose.org/products-and-publications/se-handbook).

The SysML Diagrams were created using [Cameo Systems Modeler](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/no-magic/cameo-systems-modeler/).
